# Pathfinder-Creature-Maker
- This program will allow you to input stats for a monster or NPC, and it will put it all into an easily readable pdf.

- This is a tool for Pathfinder 2e, but if you can make some kind of use of it in some other situation, feel free.

    + There are still a few features that don't work, and it's not the most self explanatory. I will be making a wiki page on this repo to explain how to use it, and hopefully show what does and doesn't work (unless I just fix everything haha).

If u have any questions, email me!
