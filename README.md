# Pathfinder-Creature-Maker
- This program will allow you to input stats for a monster or NPC into a JSON file, and it will put it all into an easily readable pdf.

- This is a tool for Pathfinder 2e, but if you can make some kind of use of it in some other situation, feel free.

- This program is still early in development. It is not perfect, but I'm working hard at improving it. Please be patient with me :)
