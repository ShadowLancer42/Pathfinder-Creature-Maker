- If it isn't starting: Be sure you have installed Python 3.

- If it still isn't working: Try running it through the terminal (look up 'how to run a file through the command terminal')

- If it isn't saving the pdf: Make sure you have entered a valid directory into the saveDirectory field in the JSON. MAKE SURE YOU ADD A '/' TO THE END OF THE DIRECTORY NAME. (ex: 'C://users/david/', not 'C://users/david')

- The program is crashing or giving an error message: Check that you have done your JSON file correctly:
	+ Make sure you have entered your info into the 'input.json' file, not any of the others. (Entering data into one of the others doesn't hurt, but they don't do anything, so be sure you also enter it into the correct one as well)
	+ Make sure you haven't accidentally forgotten any json syntax
	+ If it's still not working: you probably deleted something on accident. Copy the text from 'inputBlank.json' and paste it into 'input.json'. Now try to fill it out again.
	+ If it STILL isn't working: Email Me! -> 'glenseeber42@gmail.com'

(all of this information is specific to windows, but it might still apply to other OS's, I wouldn't know lol)
