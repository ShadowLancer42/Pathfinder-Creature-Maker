- If it isn't starting: Be sure you have installed Python 3.

- If it still isn't working: Try running it through the terminal (look up 'how to run a file through the command terminal')

- If it isn't saving the pdf: Make sure you have entered a valid directory into the SaveDirectory.txt file. The directory should be the only text on that document (No extra spaces or enters either!) 


IF IT STILL ISN'T WORKING, BE SURE YOU ADDED A '/' TO THE END OF THE DIRECTORY NAME.


(all of this information is specific to windows, but it might still apply to other OS's, I wouldn't know lol)
